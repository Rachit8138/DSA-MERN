what, how, why?

Brute force approach
optimising/ plan and approach
time and complexity- edges

qn->hints->solution videos extension if you cannot solve mark it as important

memorising is not good,

leetcode timer extension , leetcode contest. premium: premium qn, company, visual solution.

2. New data structure 
a. definition.

3. algorithm / classical questions: 
# tips and tricks 
# why the avg is O(n2) qucik sort 

# do the notes in notebook 

# HOW TO MAKE NOTES
# Logic, formulat, diagrams, pseudocode, special notes

# write the function note the whole code or pseudocode

# mention time and space complexity 
#
